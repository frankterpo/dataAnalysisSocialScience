### Hypothesis test 1

# Correlation between the UKIP 17 vote share and the percentage of england-born population?
cor.test(data$UKIP17, data$c11BornEngland)

# Female Conservative candidates vote share compared to male candidates?
t.test(data$Con17 ~ data$conservative_gender)

#Null hypothesis and an alt hypothesis

# H0: Conservative party was equally likely to run with a female candidate in safe and marginal constituencies

# HA: Conservative party was more likely to run with a female candidate in safe constituencies as compared to marginal constituencies

# Chi-squared test.
chisq.test(data$marginal, data$conservative_gender)

### Hypothesis test 2

# Are county (rural) and borough (urban) constituencies equally Conservative? 
# H0: Rural and urban constituencies are equally Conservative.
# HA: Rural and urban constituencies are not equally Conservative.
